# Lesson Plan - CSS|Advanced Selectors (Zoom Session)

:clock10: Lesson Duration: 2 hours

> Purpose: The purpose of this lesson is to <b> Consolidate the learning from the Online Lesson </b> completed by the students before this Zoom session and prepare them to the final part of the course, where they will need to submit their individual work to the Ironhack lab.

---
### Learning Goals (reminder)

After this lesson, students should be able to:

- Select elements using basic selectors
- Select elements combining different selectors
- Select elements based on their relationship to other elements
- Select elements based on their attributes

### Setup

- Make sure you have the latest version of Zoom installed on your machine
- Have all the polls/Quizzes/interactions/breakout rooms ready in the backend 
- Test your micrphone and webcam
- Find a quiet space with a simple background to avoid user's distraction
- Have the links to CodePen and other sites ready
- Make sure your material (including slides) works and have the "cheat-sheet" document for the students prepared

### Trainer Tips
Please access the 'Train the trainer' Ironhack module to review our training framework and make sure your session is aligned with it. Some additional key aspects to consider are:

👉 ENGAGEMENT
- Adapt to the class. When asking questions, you will see the understanding of the group and they may bring really interesting points that were not part of your agenda. Please try to continue the session building on their answers so they can feel they are listend.
- Allow time for discussion. Very often learning takes place when people exchange their views on a subject. Nourish those exchanges and ask them to comment on other student's ideas (always with respect, of course)

👉 CHECKS FOR UNDERSTANDING
- Use the quick polls to easily check the understanding of the lesson
- Go into each 'Breakout Room' to ask how the activity is going and if they need any help
- Notice if the "quiet students" are working on the task on CodePen

👉 REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES
- Bring websites/projects you have worked in the past
- Use of OpenSource active platforms

👉 LEARNING ACTIVITIES
- Zoom Polls
- Zoom Breakout rooms
- Code Pen exercises
- Partner Project ??Using your real-world project or OpenSource ???
- Quiz race using Kahoot or MyQuiz (optional)

### Part 1 - Recap

> :clock10: 30 min

❓  1) Launch the Initial Zoom Polls (P1 how did they find the online lesson?, P2 did they access the CodePen links?) - The results will give you an initial idea of the level of the class and how long you may spend in the CodePen examples

🗒️  2) Review concepts by sharing the "cheat-sheet" on your screen with all the codes covered in the Online Lesson. Ask the group to use the raise the hand button to answer and unmute their mics. If you see they don't use the button, explain they can also submit the answer in the chat window.

🎙️  3) Ask if they have any questions about the Online Lesson - explain they can freely unmute themselves to comment/discuss.

🖥️  4) Review in Group the CodePen activity Selecting Adjacent Siblings so everybody can test access to the site on their devices before the main activity that will take place by pairs later

### Part 2 - Hands on

> :clock10: 1h


📜  5) Group Activity using slides (3 snippets of CSS code): showing the snippets of the code you prepared, ask to identify all the advanced selectors used in it. After a bit of discussion, reveal the answer with the total and move to the next snippet.

💻  6) Working by pairs - using Zoom breakout rooms + CodePen
- Activty 1 (class divided by pairs and breakoutrooms): ask to add 5 more languages to the list and use the selectors they want to show they can work with them in the code.  
of code using split the group into pairs and send

(bring the students back to the main Zoom session to explain the instructions for the second activity)

- Activity 2: Using the 'real-live example' you brought (or using the Star Wars CodePen by JOSH https://codepen.io/spamgoblin/pen/VwbByXM)
Ask them to modify the CSS to get it similar to X (screenshot of the final look of the site you want the students to replicate) 
Check on each room, ask if they need help and suggest options accordingly.

- Quick presentation: at the end of Activity 2, bring them all back to the main Zoom session and ask them to share their screens with the group to show the results of their work with the group. Ask them about their biggest challenges for the task.


### Part 3 - Questions and Next Steps

> :clock10: 20 min

Revisit Data Analysis work flow for modeling - 2

- Fitting the model
- Making predictions on the test data
- Check model accuracy
